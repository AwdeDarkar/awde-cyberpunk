===== Discussion Log =====
Cyber cowboy.

Can I make a character as _off grid_ as possible without breaking setting?

Yes, although I'd say maybe drop the 'cyber' from your name then

Sweet. Can I be a crackshot recluse that lives in some in the woods. Maybe older fashioned fire arms aswell.

Sure, I'm thinking of you as a 'self sufficiency' type; if you can't take it apart, understand how every piece works, and ideally build one of your own, then you don't use it.
Also, I'd probably put you with a loosely connected community that does the same.
You barter with each other for supplies or expertise but otherwise stay out of each other's ways.

Yes you get a hat
We still need to dig in a bit more to develop an actual _character_. Right now you're basically just an archetype. Why's this guy living by himself in the woods?

Doesn't trust society or it's reliance on AI, for whatever valid or flawed reason.

I'm thinking along the veins that his family got driven out of business/replaced by an ai. And that he found it easier as a boy to retreat to their roots than to adjust to a new type of society.

Okay, if it's a family business thing then I'll let you in on one of the non-obvious things: the economy isn't just deflationary, it's _inverted_. Raw materials cost _more_ than finished products. If you own a bakery, the market price for a loaf of bread that costs 2 dollars to bake is only a buck ninety.
Not everywhere, mind you, but in many places and industries
I'm thinking your family owned a small business in a city (a Knoxville-sized city, maybe). And they were driven out of business by the market pressures.

Ok so maybe no malice towards AI, but society in general

Mid to Late 20's, Probably since he was 8 or 10
Learned the ways under his father.

Pretty young start, he's probably only been getting limited information from the rest of society

He knows the woods, game, firearms, and plants.

Probably has limited agreements with a nearby community. Probably comes every now and then for salts, bullets, wax, etc. But otherwise avoids others if possible.
So sociable aslong as they arent near his hole.

-Hat he never takes off
-standardizes his ammo to make buying/making bullets easier. (38 magnum for handguns, 30-30 continental for the rifle.)
-His hole is probably near a creek, but not next to one
-Probably grows tomatoes and potatoes.
-Uses bullets very sparingly.
-Shaves almost religously.

(2) .38 double action revolvers and (1) 67 winchester should complete the cowboy aestetic.
Probably a scope on the rifle.
